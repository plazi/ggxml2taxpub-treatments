The localities at which 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. potiguar
</tp:taxon-name>
has been recorded are situated in a karstic limestone formation, known as the Apodi group, dated to the late Cretaceous. The area is situated in the Caatinga biome, the only semi-arid biome in 
Brazil
, with low rainfall most of the year. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Charinus potiguar
</tp:taxon-name>
is widespread within the formation, but its abundance in each cave is usually low (3.9 ± 3.4 individuals). 

Vasconcelos 
et al
. (2013)

suggested that caves might not be the primary habitat of the species, noting that more individuals were found in the caves during the dry season. For example, in 16 caves sampled during the dry and wet seasons, the abundance was significantly higher in the dry season than in the rainy season (
t
-value: -2.91, p = 0.007), which, according to 

Vasconcelos 
et al
. (2013)

suggests that specimens are migrating into the caves when the outside climate is unfavourable. L.S. Carvalho (pers. com.) noted that specimens can be found under rocks at the entrance of the caves. Specimens are usually found on the cave walls, although immatures were frequently found under rocks on the floor. A schizomid,

Supplementary description
</p>
      <p>CARAPACE. Six anterior setae; frontal process triangular, with oval apex, not visible in dorsal view. Small granules densely scattered between ocular triads and among sulci; lateral carapace margin, ventral to lateral eyes with small carina. Median eyes present, reduced, median ocular tubercle shallow, with pair of setae; lateral eyes reduced, pale, seta posterior to lateral ocular triad.</p>
      <p>STERNUM. Tritosternum projected anteriorly, with typical setation; other sternal platelets narrow and concave, with pair of setae anteriorly on plaque and some smaller setae posteriorly; pentasternum with 20 setae anteriorly and five setae on membranous region.</p>
      <p>OPISTHOSOMA. Ventral sacs and ventral sac cover absent.</p>
      <p>GENITALIA. Female genital operculum with prominent setae posteromedially and some smaller setae near margin; gonopod sucker-like, constriction near apex, creating shape of bottleneck; gonopods markedly sclerotized basally. Male gonopod with base of fistula and lateral lobe sclerotized; lateral lobe 2 fimbriate.</p>
      <p>CHELICERAE. Small tooth projecting from retrolateral surface of basal segment, opposite to bifid tooth; retrolateral surface of claw with two patches of setae, medially and basally; claw with thirteen teeth and transverse row of around thirteen setae on prolateral surface of basal segment; bifid tooth on basal segment with dorsal cusp larger than ventral cusp.</p>
      <p>PEDIPALPS. Coxal dorsal carina with two prominent setae encircled by round carina and three setae on margin. Femur with four dorsal spines and four ventral spines; two prominent setiferous tubercles between dorsal spine 1 and proximal margin; spine between ventral spine 1 and proximal margin. Patella with three dorsal spines in primary series; prominent setiferous tubercle distal to spine I, one-third length of spine I; two ventral spines in primary series; prominent setiferous tubercle between spine I and distal margin. Tibia with ventral spine distally and five setae between spine and distal margin. Tarsus with two dorsal spines, proximal spine one-third length of distal spine; cleaning organ with 28–30 setae in ventral row.</p>
      <p>
LEGS. Tibia of leg I with 23 articles; tarsus I with 41 articles; first tarsal article same length as second article. Leg IV basitibia with four pseudo-articles, with sclerotized, denticulate margin projecting from apex of articles; trichobothrium

situated in proximal third of pseudo-article; distitibia trichobothrium 
bc
situated closer to 
sbf
than to

Natural history

      <p>
The localities at which 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. potiguar
</tp:taxon-name>
has been recorded are situated in a karstic limestone formation, known as the Apodi group, dated to the late Cretaceous. The area is situated in the Caatinga biome, the only semi-arid biome in 
Brazil
, with low rainfall most of the year. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Charinus potiguar
</tp:taxon-name>
is widespread within the formation, but its abundance in each cave is usually low (3.9 ± 3.4 individuals). 

Vasconcelos 
et al
. (2013)

suggested that caves might not be the primary habitat of the species, noting that more individuals were found in the caves during the dry season. For example, in 16 caves sampled during the dry and wet seasons, the abundance was significantly higher in the dry season than in the rainy season (
t
-value: -2.91, p = 0.007), which, according to 

Vasconcelos 
et al
. (2013)

suggests that specimens are migrating into the caves when the outside climate is unfavourable. L.S. Carvalho (pers. com.) noted that specimens can be found under rocks at the entrance of the caves. Specimens are usually found on the cave walls, although immatures were frequently found under rocks on the floor. A schizomid,

inhabit the same caves (L.S. Carvalho, pers. com.). Potential prey species observed in the cave included crickets (
