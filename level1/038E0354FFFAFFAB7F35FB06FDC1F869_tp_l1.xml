Drepanoistodus stougei
</tp:taxon-name>
was first described by 
Rasmussen (1991)
and further morphological details for all the four element 
types
were subsequently added by 
Rasmussen (2001)
. The most distinct features are the rounded anterior margin and the relatively long upper margin on the base. In the material at hand, the b/c ratio (see 
Fig. 3
) mean is 0.50 and angle A has a mean of 27.4°. In some cases, 
<tp:taxon-name>
D. svendi
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
is characterized by a similarly rounded anterior margin but is distinguished by its (weakly) curved cusp and carina. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Drepanoistodus
aff. 
basiovalis
</tp:taxon-name>
morphotypes with a rounded anterior margin are separated from 
<tp:taxon-name>
D. stougei
</tp:taxon-name>
by the characteristically extended keel in the upper anterior corner of the former taxon. Because 
<tp:taxon-name>
D. stougei
</tp:taxon-name>
is included here just for comparison with the new species described, synonymy or further descriptive details have not been incorporated, but can be found in 
Rasmussen (1991
, 
2001
).
