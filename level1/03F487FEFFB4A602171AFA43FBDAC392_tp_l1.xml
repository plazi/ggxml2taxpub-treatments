Rostrum (
Fig. 9A
) forms a triangle with an acute or narrowly rounded tip, 50–65% length of terminal segment of antennular trunk. Cornea (
Fig. 9
A–C) occupies distal 30–40% eye surface. Eyestalks with smooth surface except for a prominent tooth on disto-mesial edge. Antennular trunk (
Fig. 10
A–D) with two large, subapically flagellate spines in addition to normal setae, namely one spine on disto-mesial edge of median segment, and a broader one on disto-mesial edge of terminal segment. Distal 8–12% of the latter spine rugged on its obliquely truncate margin. Dorsal apophysis of basal segment with one strong, apically rugged, non-flagellate spine. Antennal scale (
Fig. 10E
) and antennal peduncle ending at about same height; scale length is 2.9–3.3 times maximum width; scale with small apical segment separated by a transverse suture. Male thoracic sternites 1–8 each with one median, ventral process (
Fig. 9D

Figs 10I, L
; 
11A
). Thoracic endopod 3 (
Fig. 10I, L

Fig. 11
C–L) rudimentary, unsegmented, with residual differentiation of endopod (pseudobranchial lobe). Female pleopods 1, 3–5 and male pleopods 1, 5 with normal setae only, no spines. Pleopod 2 of both sexes with smooth spine (stylet) on apex and 5–6 minute flagellate spines in series along outer (= lateral) margin of elongate distal portion. Pleopods 3–4 dimorphic. Male pleopod 3 with 2–7 large flagellate spines (numbers include bilateral variability), densely set along obliquely truncate, terminal margin; male pleopod 4 with dense series of 11–12 (intermediate in size between the spines of pleopods 2 and 3) flagellate spines in analogous position. Exopod of uropods (

Description
</p>
      <p>
All features of diagnosis. General appearance small, robust (
Fig. 9A
). For body size see above ‘Material examined’. Cephalothorax comprises 28–34% of body length, pleon (without telson) 54–67%, and carapace (without rostrum) 20–31%. Abdominal somites 1–5 measure 0.7–1.0, 0.6–1.0, 0.7–0.9, 0.7– 0.9, and 0.6–1.0 times the length of somite 6, respectively.
</p>
      <p>
CARAPACE (
Fig. 9B
). Carapace covers 70–81% of cephalothorax dorsally. Rostrum reaches at most to distal ⅔ of artificially straight forward-oriented eyestalks (without cornea). Cervical sulcus short but strong. Cervical pore group consists of 11–15 pores with about 
1 µm
diameter in a roughly U-shaped arrangement. Posterior margin leaving 1–2 posterior thoracic somites mid-dorsally exposed.
</p>
      <p>
EYES (
Fig. 9
A–C). Eyestalks and cornea dorsoventrally compressed (
Fig. 9A
). Eyestalks without scales. In dorsal view (
Fig. 9
B–C) the cornea appears calotte-shaped, measuring 0.8–1.0 times length of eyestalk (cornea not included). In lateral view (
Fig. 9A
) the cornea appears ovoid with flattened ventral margin, length 1.5 times maximum width.
</p>
      <p>
ANTENNULAE (
Fig. 10
A–D). Trunk extends 40–58% its length beyond eyes, 19–40% beyond antennal scale. Measured without apophysis along dorsal midline, basal segment is 32–47% trunk length, median

MALE THORACIC STERNITES. Size increases from sternal processes 1–3, remains subequal from 3 to 6, and decreases from 6 to 8 (

).
</p>
      <p>
THORACOPODS (general; 
Figs 10
I–M, 11A–B). Length of flagella as well as of basal plates increases from exopod 1 to 6 and decreases from exopod 6 to 8. Basal plates (
Fig. 11A

Basis of endopods 4–8 with small, lappet-like apophysis on rostral face below endopod (below drawing plane, therefore visualized by dashed lines in 
Fig. 11A
). Total length of endopods increases in series of thoracopods 1, 2, 4, 3, 5–8. Ischium becomes longer and more slender from endopods 1–6, while both features remain subequal among endopods 6–8. Ischium shorter than merus in endopods 1–4 (

), but longer than merus in endopods 5–8 (
Fig. 11A
). Thoracic endopods with claw 3 longest, claw 1 about half length of claw 3, claws 4–8 measure ¼ to ½ of claw 3; claw 2, if any, not detected. Claws 3–4 smooth (
Fig. 10I, L

In both sexes, combined praeischium plus ischium are 0.8–0.9 times length of merus, carpopropodus plus dactylus 0.9–1.1 times merus. Dactylus very large, with dense brush formed by large numbers of normal setae and 11–13 modified setae, the latter apically bent, bearing two symmetrical series of denticles (stiff barbs) on either side in subbasal to median portions.

70–110 µm
, thickness 
40–45 µm
