Description
</p>
      <p>
CARAPACE. Six anterior setae; frontal process triangular (
Fig. 64C
). Small granules densely scattered between lateral eyes and among sulci. Median eyes well developed (
Fig. 64C
); median ocular tubercle reduced, with pair of setae; lateral eyes well developed, with seta posterior to lateral ocular triad; lateral ocular triad well separated from carapace margin (
Fig. 64A
).
</p>
      <p>
STERNUM. Tritosternum projected anteriorly with typical setation, long, surpassing base of pedipalp coxae (
Fig. 64B
); other sternal platelets narrow and concave, with pair of setae anteriorly on plaque and few smaller setae posteriorly; pentasternum with ten setae anteriorly and six setae (three pairs) near membranous region.
</p>
      <p>OPISTHOSOMA. Ventral sacs and ventral sac cover absent.</p>
      <p>
GENITALIA. Female genital operculum with prominent setae posteromedially and some smaller setae near margin; gonopod sucker-like and markedly sclerotized basally; constricted near apex, giving appearence of bottleneck (
Fig. 65A–D
). Male gonopod with apical margin of fistula and lateral lobe sclerotized; lateral lobes fimbriate.
</p>
      <p>CHELICERAE. Small, flat tooth on retrolateral surface of basal segment, opposite to bifid tooth; retrolateral surface of claw with continous row of setae, basally to medially; claw with ten teeth; three rows of 32 setae on prolateral surface of basal segment; bifid tooth on basal segment with dorsal cusp larger than ventral cusp.</p>
      <p>
PEDIPALPS. Coxal dorsal carina with seven prominent setae encircled by round carina and four setae on margin. Femur with six dorsal spines and five ventral spines (
Fig. 64E–F
); one dorsal spine between spines 2 and 3; two prominent setiferous tubercles between dorsal spine 1 and proximal margin; spine between ventral spine 1 and proximal margin; spine between ventral spines 1 and 2 and spines 3 and 4. Patella with six dorsal spines in primary series (
Fig. 64E
); prominent setiferous tubercle distal to spine I, one-third length of spine I; three or four ventral spines (
Fig. 64F
); prominent setiferous tubercle between spine I and distal margin. Tibia with ventral spine distally and three setae between spine and distal margin. Tarsus with three dorsal spines, larger spines aligned (
Fig. 64D
); spine 3 near base of spine 1; of larger spines, spine 1 two thirds length of spine 2; cleaning organ with 28–31 setae in ventral row.
</p>
      <p>
LEGS. Tibia of leg I with 23 articles; tarsus I with 41 articles; first tarsal article about same length as subsequent article. Leg IV basitibia with four pseudo-articles, with sclerotized, denticulate margin at apex of articles; trichobothrium 
bt
situated submedially on pseudo-article; distitibia trichobothrium 
bc
situated closer to 
sbf

Remarks
</p>
      <p>
As indicated by the measurements (
Table 4
), the 
holotype
is much larger than the 
paratypes
; the male 
paratype
, despite being smaller, exhibits almost the same number of spines on the pedipalp as the 
holotype
, the only difference being five instead of six dorsal spines on the femur, and fewer teeth on the cheliceral claw (eight instead of ten); the male 
paratype
is probably subadult. The 
paratype
females exhibit more differences in the count of spines on the pedipalp, which might be due to their early stage of development. Both males possess three dorsal spines on the pedipalp tarsus.
