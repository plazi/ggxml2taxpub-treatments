Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>Well-developed rostral scale, elongated and with free edges; 8 or 9 supralabials, fourth and fifth or fifth and sixth supralabial in contact with the eye; normally 10 infralabials; a single loreal scale; preocular divided; prenasal scale in contact with the second supralabial; a second pair of chinshields separated by a row of scales; 178–200 ventral scales and 89–106 subcaudals; maxillary teeth normally 10 +3. Color pattern consists of a pale vertebral line extending to the top of the head, three to five rows of scales wide on the first third of the body reduced to only three on posteriorly; head bordered by a pair of continuous dorsolateral lines from the loreal region throughout the body, with dark line on the sixth and seventh lines of dorsal scales; Sometimes with an inconspicuous lateral line at third row of dorsal scales.</p>
