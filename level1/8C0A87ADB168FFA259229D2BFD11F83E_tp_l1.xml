Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>
A species morphologically similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. manoelfelixii
</tp:taxon-name>
because it has glabrous to glabrescent, lustrous vegetative parts and inflorescences. However, 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. alatum
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
differs from this and other species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ameroglossum
</tp:taxon-name>
, by having conspicuous membranous wings on the stem extending to the peduncle of the inflorescence and the pedicel (vs not or sparsely winged). Because of its green stems and leaves, 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. alatum
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
may also appear similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. bicolor
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
, although it differs by having its inflorescence in a simple dichasium (vs compound dichasium), winged peduncles and pedicels (vs partially winged) and the sepals not overlapping (vs sepals overlapping).

Etymology
</p>
      <p>
The name is derived from the Latin adjective ʻ 
<tp:taxon-name>
alatus
</tp:taxon-name>
ʼ, ʻwingedʼ, referring to the conspicuous wings on the branches, peduncles and pedicels.

</p>
         <p>
Population and threats
</p>
         <p>
The population is composed of approximately 
20 adult
individuals, restricted to an area of approximately 
3000 m
² on one of the tops of this granite outcrop. The small population demonstrates elevated homozygosity, suggesting a low genetic diversity, probably caused by a founder and/or a genetic bottleneck effect (

Wanderley 
et al.
2018

).

            <p>This species is distinguished by the presence of two conspicuous wings on the dorsal sepal (vs calys without wings in all other species). It also has leaves that are rough to the touch with aciculate hairs (vs glabrous or softly hairy in all other species).</p>

The epithet derives from the Latin ʻ

               <p>
Flowering and fruiting was observed in June and October. The rocky outcrop where the species was collected is located at the edge of a secondary road near the Usina Serra Grande sugarcane plantation, 
Alagoas State
, and was probably originally surrounded by Atlantic Forest vegetation.
</p>
               <p>
Population and threats
</p>
               <p>
There is only a single known isolated population of this species, occupying an area of less than 
10 km
2

. In addition to the degradation of the surrounding habitat due to agricultural expansion, we observed invasion of the outcrop by 
<tp:taxon-name>
Furcraea foetida
</tp:taxon-name>
(L.) Haw. (
<tp:taxon-name>Asparagaceae</tp:taxon-name>
), resulting in competition for space and consequent reduction of the population of this newly described taxon.

Population and threats

                  <p>
A population of 
70 adult
individuals is known from a granite outcrop known as Lajedo do Boi in the municipality of Agrestina; at least 40 individuals are known from the Pedra do Guariba granite outcrop in the municipality of Caruaru (

Wanderley 
et al.
2014a

); four other individuals were also located in Caruaru at Serra da Quitéria; 
50 adult
individuals are estimated to compose the population in the municipality of Bonito, all in 
Pernambuco State
, 
Brazil
. Main threats to these populations are habitat destruction through trampling by domestic animals, burning and other agricultural activity.

Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>This species is distinguished by the presence of two conspicuous wings on the dorsal sepal (vs calys without wings in all other species). It also has leaves that are rough to the touch with aciculate hairs (vs glabrous or softly hairy in all other species).</p>

Etymology
</p>
      <p>
The epithet derives from the Latin ʻ 
asper
ʼ, ʻroughʼ, and ʻ 
folium

         <p>
Flowering and fruiting was observed in June and October. The rocky outcrop where the species was collected is located at the edge of a secondary road near the Usina Serra Grande sugarcane plantation, 
Alagoas State
, and was probably originally surrounded by Atlantic Forest vegetation.
</p>
         <p>
Population and threats
</p>
         <p>
There is only a single known isolated population of this species, occupying an area of less than 
10 km
2

. In addition to the degradation of the surrounding habitat due to agricultural expansion, we observed invasion of the outcrop by 
<tp:taxon-name>
Furcraea foetida
</tp:taxon-name>
(L.) Haw. (
<tp:taxon-name>Asparagaceae</tp:taxon-name>
), resulting in competition for space and consequent reduction of the population of this newly described taxon.

         <tp:taxon-name>
Ameroglossum bicolor
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
has been collected in flower from May to October, with high inter- and intrapopulational synchrony (

Population and threats
</p>
      <p>
A population of 
70 adult
individuals is known from a granite outcrop known as Lajedo do Boi in the municipality of Agrestina; at least 40 individuals are known from the Pedra do Guariba granite outcrop in the municipality of Caruaru (

Wanderley 
et al.
2014a

); four other individuals were also located in Caruaru at Serra da Quitéria; 
50 adult
individuals are estimated to compose the population in the municipality of Bonito, all in 
Pernambuco State
, 
Brazil
. Main threats to these populations are habitat destruction through trampling by domestic animals, burning and other agricultural activity.
