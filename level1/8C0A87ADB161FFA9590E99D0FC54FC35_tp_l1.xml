This species is similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>
A. manoelfelixii
</tp:taxon-name>
in having lustrous, purple-tinged vegetative parts and scarlet flowers, but it differs in having inflorescences in simple dichasia (vs compound dichasia), peduncle winged (vs peduncle not winged) and white trichomes on the lower lip of the corolla (vs trichomes violet). It differs from the other species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ameroglossum
</tp:taxon-name>
by the deep vinaceous colour of its vegetative parts.

Etymology
</p>
      <p>
The specific epithet is dedicated to the Fulni-ô Amerindians whose territories are located in the Serra do Comunaty where the 
type
material was collected. Members of the Fulni-ô ethnic group have conserved many of their traditional cultural values, being one of the few indigenous groups in north-eastern 
Brazil
that have conserved their original language, Yaathe or Ia-tê, from the Macro-Jê linguistic branch.

This species occurs exclusively on granite outcrops. Flowering and fruiting recorded in August and like all other 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ameroglossum

</tp:taxon-name>
it is pollinated by hummingbirds. The surrounding vegetation was probably originally composed of deciduous forest, but this has now been replaced by natural pasture.

Population and threats
</p>
      <p>
Only two rock outcrops separated by pasture in a single municipality in 
Alagoas State
are known to harbour this species. Approximately 
200 adult
individuals can be found in the first population, whereas the other comprises approximately 30 individuals. The main threat to these populations are farming and grazing of the site by stray animals.
