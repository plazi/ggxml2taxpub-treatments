The specific epithet is in honor of Dr Roger J. Blahnik (University of 
Minnesota
,

Fig. 1C
). Maxillary palp with segments 1–4 increasing gradually about 0.8× in size toward more apical segments, segment 5 long, about 1.2× as long as all previous segments combined (
Fig. 1B
). Thorax pale brown, without setae (old specimens); legs brown, with mid leg tarsi yellowish (
Fig. 1A
). Wing venation typical for subgenus (
Fig. 1D–E
). Forewings, in alcohol, uniformly brown, with small white spot on apex of Cu2 (
Fig. 1D

MALE GENITALIA (
Fig. 2
). Segment IX in lateral view with anterolateral margin nearly straight, strongly sclerotized (
Fig. 2A
); posterodorsal margin bearing small spicules, distributed in a subtriangular band (
Fig. 2B
). Tergum X elongate; in lateral view, ventrolateral margin strongly sclerotized, with four mediumsized, thin setae on apical third; apex with sharp notch, ending in slender, straight lobe (
Fig. 2A
); in dorsal view, lateral margin rounded; dorsomesal setose area bearing three medium-sized, thin setae; divided apicomesally by V-shaped incision about ¼ its length; apex of tergite rounded, with strong, pointed apicomesal lobe, touching distally, each bearing one pair of long, stout subapical setae and one pair of short, thin apical setae (
Fig. 2B

Inferior appendages 2-segmented; basal segment long, slightly inflated distally, covered with long, thin setae, with a group of stout apical spine-like setae, one long seta dorsally and four medium-sized setae on mesal margin; apical segment short, about ⅓ as long as basal segment, thick, slightly curved medially, apex rounded with numerous short, thin setae on mesal margin (
Fig. 2B
). Phallic apparatus long and tubular; basal section, in lateral view, enlarged, 4× diameter of phallotheca at its narrowest point, forming an angle of about 93° with apical section; median section of phallotheca straight, with dorsal periphalic cap sclerotized, slender, and upturned (
Fig. 2C
); apex enlarged, without processes or plates; endothecal membranes without spines; phallotremal sclerite, in dorsal view, distinct, strongly sclerotized, stethoscope-shaped, proximal region slightly bifid and distal region with acute arms (
Fig. 2D–E

sp. nov.
were collected near a 1 
st
order stream, where the predominant vegetation is highland savanna with a minimum altitude of 
1112 m
a.s.l. (
Fig 4A
). This stream is located in the Serra do Aracá mountain range, northern Brazilian Amazon. The water in the stream was black and acidic (pH 4.6), with low conductivity (10 
μScm-1
), and a water temperature of 22°C. The stream was about 
0.5 m
wide, 
0.30 m
deep, with rocky bottoms characterized by boulders and slow-flowing water.
