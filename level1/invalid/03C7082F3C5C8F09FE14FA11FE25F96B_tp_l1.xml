</p>
      <p>COLORATION. Body brown, head, elytra black, with an orange marking at vertex, pronotum and scutellum testaceous, pronotum more or less lightened at anterior angles, prosternum, coxae and bases of inner margins of femora yellow. Body densely covered with short, semi-recumbent pale pubescence.</p>
      <p>HEAD. Subquadrate, surface densely and finely punctate, each side with a smooth and rectangular impression behind antennal socket; eyes large, strongly protruding, head width across eyes 1.4 times as wide as pronotum; terminal maxillary palpomeres long-triangular, widest in middle; antennae filiform, almost reaching apices of elytra, antennomeres II about 1.5 times as long as wide at apices, III about 2.3 times longer than II, IV‒XI cylindrically thickened and each with a small and smooth longitudinal impression in middle of outer edge, IV widest, V to XI gradually narrowing towards apex, XI slightly longer than X, pointed at apex.</p>
      <p>PRONOTUM. Subquadrate, about 1.2 times as long as wide, anterior margin arcuate, anterior angles obtuse, sub-rectangular, lateral margins slightly sinuate, posterior margin slightly sinuate and narrowly bordered, posterior angles sub-rectangular, disc strongly convex on posterolateral parts, surface finely and densely punctate.</p>
      <p>ELYTRA. Nearly parallel-sided, about 3.5 times as long as humeral width, 4.4 times longer than pronotum, surface finely and densely punctate, with hardly visible longitudinal costae.</p>
      <p>
AEDEAGUS (
Fig. 10A‒C
). Moderately swollen laterally at basal part, strongly reduced in diameter apically; basal piece nearly as long as dorsal plate of each paramere, with a large, bifurcate conjoined middle nodule at base of ventral side; ventral processes parameres approaching each other, short and slightly narrowed apically, bent ventrally in lateral view; dorsal plates slightly longer than ventral processes, strongly narrowed near base, approaching each other, apex acute and directed ventrally; apical parts of laterophyses depressed and separated from each other, apex acute and not reaching middle emargination between dorsal plates.
