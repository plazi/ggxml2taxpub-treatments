as a member of the 
<tp:taxon-name>
Z. platylabum

BODY LENGTH. Male (
holotype
): length 
26.3 mm
, width of thoracic shield 
16.1 mm
, of tergite 7 
16.7 mm
(widest), height of thoracic shield 
8.9 mm
, of tergite 7 
9.3 mm
(highest).
</p>
      <p>
COLORATION. Head, collum, thoracic shield and tergites light brown with dark posterior margins. Anal shield entirely light brown (
Fig. 2E
). Antennae dark green, legs basally light brown, apically green.
</p>
      <p>HEAD. Eyes with more than 65 ommatidia. Antennae short, protruding back to leg 5. Length of antennomeres 1=2 =3=4 =5&lt;6. A shallow groove present on antennomere 1, disc with 48/49 apical cones.</p>
      <p>GNATHOCHILARIUM AND MANDIBLE. Not dissected.</p>
      <p>
STIGMATIC PLATES. First stigmatic plate triangular, apex sharply edged, pointed, turned towards coxa. Hairs most abundant on apical margin (
Fig. 9C
).
</p>
      <p>PLEURITES. First pleurite extending posteriorly in a well-rounded process. Second pleurite also with a well-rounded process, but not projecting. Remaining pleurites broadly rounded.</p>
      <p>COLLUM. Margins with a few short hairs, central part glabrous.</p>
      <p>THORACIC SHIELD. Surface like those of tergites, glabrous.</p>
      <p>
TERGITES. Smooth and glabrous, no small pits present. Paratergites projecting slightly posteriorly. ENDOTERGUM. Inner section with numerous short spines and isolated bristles. Between marginal ridge and inner area a single row of sparse, circular cuticular impressions. Externally two dense rows of marginal bristles. Bristles scaly, the longest reaching above tergite margin (
Fig. 5E
).
