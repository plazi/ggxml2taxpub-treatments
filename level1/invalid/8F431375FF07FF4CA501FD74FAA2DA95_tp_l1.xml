            <p> Diagnosis </p>
            <p> Based in part on Weygoldt (2006a) , this species may be separated from other species
                  of <tp:taxon-name> Charinus </tp:taxon-name> in New Caledonia by the slightly
                  larger size, and more vivid colouration. It differs from <tp:taxon-name> C.
                        cavernicolus </tp:taxon-name> , in particular, by the form and decoration of
                  the male spermatophore, and the presence of a spine between ventral spine 1 and
                  the proximal margin of the pedipalp femur. </p>

            <p> Latin adjective referring to the elegant appearance of the species, due to the
                  brighter coloration and longer legs ( Weygoldt 2006 ). </p>
