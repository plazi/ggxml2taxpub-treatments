            <p> Description </p>
            <p> Color and morphology of live animals ( Fig. 64 ) Live animals are usually not
                  covered with mud, and their natural color is usually mostly visible without
                  washing. The dorsal notum varies from light brown to dark brown, almost black. The
                  hyponotum varies from grey to dark blue, almost black. The foot is yellowish-grey
                  to dark grey (almost black). Dorsal papillae are short (&lt; 1 mm ) and do not
                  bear eyes. Large, thorny papillae are absent. </p>
            <p> Digestive system ( Figs 3 C–E, 65–66, 67A) Radulae measure up to 5.2 mm long.
                  Examples of radular formulae are presented in Table 5 . The intestinal loops are
                  of type III, with a transitional loop oriented between 1 and 6 o’clock ( Figs 3
                  C–E, 66A–B). The intestinal loops of the lectotype ( Fig. 67A ) are
                  indistinguishable from those observed in a specimen from Sulawesi ( Fig. 66B ). </p>
            <p> Reproductive system ( Figs 67 B–68) In the posterior part of the reproductive
                  system, the oviduct is slightly wider than the deferent duct. Its distal section
                  (distal to the spermatheca) is slightly shorter than its proximal section (or of
                  the same length). The deferent duct is much longer than the oviduct, not attached
                  to it, and highly coiled with long loops. The distal, flexible region of the penis
                  is from 1 to 2.5 mm long and bears no hooks. The posterior retractor muscle of the
                  penis inserts within the anterior half of the visceral cavity (and near the
                  nervous system in specimens from Halmahera). The retractor muscle varies from
                  approximately half the length of the penial sheath to as long as the penial
                  sheath. The deferent duct is highly convoluted, with many loops around the penis.
                  The deferent duct is twice as wide distally as proximally. </p>

            <p> Distinctive diagnostic features ( Table 4 ) </p>
            <p> Externally, the lack of dorsal eyes is shared by both <tp:taxon-name> Platevindex
                        amboinae </tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name> P. latus </tp:taxon-name> .
                  However, the lack of dorsal eyes should be used with caution for identification
                  because dorsal eyes often are retracted (and thus hard to see). <tp:taxon-name>
                        Platevindex amboinae </tp:taxon-name> can be distinguished from
                        <tp:taxon-name> P. latus </tp:taxon-name> by the presence of smaller dorsal
                  papillae (the papillae of <tp:taxon-name> P. latus </tp:taxon-name> are larger and
                  thorny). Internally, intestinal loops of type III are found in only two species of
                        <tp:taxon-name> Platevindex </tp:taxon-name> , <tp:taxon-name> P. amboinae
                  </tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name> P. latus </tp:taxon-name> . Both species,
                  however, can be distinguished by the deferent duct in the anterior reproductive
                  system, which seems to be slightly more convoluted in <tp:taxon-name> P. amboinae
                  </tp:taxon-name> than in <tp:taxon-name> P. latus </tp:taxon-name> , although this
                  should probably be evaluated with additional individuals. Based on the available
                  data, however, <tp:taxon-name> P. amboinae </tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name> P.
                        latus </tp:taxon-name> do not overlap geographically ( Fig. 10 ). </p>

            <p>
                  <tp:taxon-name> Onchidium amboinae </tp:taxon-name> needs to be transferred to the
                  genus <tp:taxon-name> Platevindex </tp:taxon-name> due to the following
                  combination of characters of the lectotype : flattened body, male pore slightly to
                  the right of the midline between the ocular tentacles and no accessory penial
                  gland. Plate (1893: 178) also indicated that there is a rectal gland in the
                  original description, and it is clearly present in the lectotype (as in all
                        <tp:taxon-name> Platevindex </tp:taxon-name> slugs). The absence of dorsal
                  eyes and a short penis with no hooks mentioned by Plate (1893: 177) were confirmed
                  by our examination of the lectotype . The hyponotum color was described as black
                  with a white margin ( 1 to 1.5 mm wide), which is exactly what was observed in one
                  of our live specimens. However, Plate (1893: 178) described an intestine of type
                  II in <tp:taxon-name> Onchidium amboinae </tp:taxon-name> , while the intestine of
                  the lectotype (and of all newly-collected individuals) is clearly of type III (
                  Fig. 67A ). </p>

            <p> The holotype of <tp:taxon-name> P. coecus </tp:taxon-name> (by monotypy) is
                  characterized by a combination of traits diagnostic of species of <tp:taxon-name>
                        Platevindex </tp:taxon-name> : a flattened body, a male opening slightly to
                  the right of the midline between the ocular tentacles, a rectal gland and no
                  accessory penial gland. In the original description, Plate (1893:199– 200)
                  indicated a grayish-yellow sole and a black-blue hyponotum with a white margin,
                  and also the absence of dorsal eyes. The only species in Ambon which lacks dorsal
                  eyes is <tp:taxon-name> P. amboinae </tp:taxon-name> . Hoffmann (1928: 86–87)
                  transferred <tp:taxon-name> Onchidium amboinae </tp:taxon-name> to <tp:taxon-name>
                        Oncis </tp:taxon-name> (i.e., <tp:taxon-name> Platevindex </tp:taxon-name> )
                  and considered <tp:taxon-name> Oncis coeca </tp:taxon-name> (i.e., <tp:taxon-name>
                        Platevindex coecus </tp:taxon-name> ) to be a synonym of <tp:taxon-name>
                        Oncis amboinae </tp:taxon-name> (i.e., <tp:taxon-name> Platevindex amboinae
                  </tp:taxon-name> ). Labbé (1934: 234–235) agreed with Hoffmann even though he did
                  not examine any new material. The deferent duct in the penial apparatus and in the
                  posterior part of the reproductive system is extremely convoluted, exactly like in
                        <tp:taxon-name> P. amboinae </tp:taxon-name> . The pieces of the intestine
                  of the holotype were put together and are of type III, although Plate (1893: 200)
                  described a digestive system of type II. There is no anatomical difference between
                  the name-bearing types of <tp:taxon-name> Platevindex coecus </tp:taxon-name> and
                        <tp:taxon-name> P. amboinae </tp:taxon-name> , both of which were described
                  from Ambon , Indonesia . We did not find <tp:taxon-name> Platevindex amboinae
                  </tp:taxon-name> during our mangrove survey in Ambon but we found it on the nearby
                  island of Seram, where it seems to be rare. <tp:taxon-name> Platevindex amboinae
                  </tp:taxon-name> was also rare in Halmahera. It may still be present in Ambon ,
                  but most likely as a rare species. </p>
            <p> Two lots previously identified as <tp:taxon-name> Oncis lata </tp:taxon-name> from
                  Sulawesi are re-identified here as <tp:taxon-name> P. amboinae </tp:taxon-name>
                  (ZMB/Moll 46314, SMF 333602/3). The original label for ZMB/Moll 46314 indicates
                  that the specimens were collected in Luwu by M. Weber, which means that they are
                  very likely the specimens which von Martens (1897: 128) identified as
                        <tp:taxon-name> Oncis lata </tp:taxon-name> . Von Martens indicated that he
                  examined 10 specimens . Five of those are in Berlin (ZMB/Moll 46314) and three of
                  them are in Frankfurt-am-Main (SMF 333602/3), which were originally part of the
                  Heidelberg collections. The specimens examined here all lack dorsal eyes, a
                  character shared by both <tp:taxon-name> P. lata </tp:taxon-name> and
                        <tp:taxon-name> P. amboinae </tp:taxon-name> , but they also lack the large,
                  thorny papillae that are diagnostic of <tp:taxon-name> P. lata </tp:taxon-name> ,
                  suggesting that they belong to <tp:taxon-name> P. amboinae </tp:taxon-name> . </p>
            <p> Labbé (1934: 234–235) described a specimen (14/ 11 mm ) from New Zealand which he
                  identified as <tp:taxon-name> Oncis amboinae </tp:taxon-name> . However, if
                  Labbé’s description is accurate, this specimen cannot be part of <tp:taxon-name>
                        Platevindex amboinae </tp:taxon-name> or any species of <tp:taxon-name>
                        Platevindex </tp:taxon-name> because Labbé (1934: 235) indicated that a
                  group of dorsal eyes was present in the middle of the notum (in <tp:taxon-name>
                        Platevindex </tp:taxon-name> , dorsal eyes are always single). It is unclear
                  which species Labbé examined, as <tp:taxon-name> Onchidella </tp:taxon-name> is
                  the only onchidiid genus documented so far in New Zealand . The combination of
                  traits mentioned in the brief description (dorsal eyes, no accessory penial gland
                  and no penial hooks), suggests it could be a <tp:taxon-name> Wallaconchis
                  </tp:taxon-name> slug, although that is incompatible with intestinal loops of type
                  II. Besides, <tp:taxon-name> Wallaconchis </tp:taxon-name> is not known south of
                  New Caledonia . Most likely, as often with Labbé’s work, the locality or the
                  description, or even both, are erroneous ( Dayrat et al. 2020 ). </p>
