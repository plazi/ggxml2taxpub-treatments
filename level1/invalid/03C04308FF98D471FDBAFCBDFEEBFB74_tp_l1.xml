Remarks
</p>
      <p>
Under his discussion of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ag. virescens
, 
Cockerell (1921)
</tp:taxon-name>
included a brief mention of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Apis vitreus
</tp:taxon-name>
, originally named and described from the male (with a colour illustration) by 
Harris (1782
: pl 39 fig. 17); in the figure caption, 
Harris (1782)
mentioned the brilliant green head and thorax, with yellow mouthparts, antennae, legs and abdomen, the latter with six black bands, which is consistent with most male 
<tp:taxon-name>
Agapostemon
</tp:taxon-name>
in North America (e.g., 
Roberts 1972
). 
Cockerell (1921)
felt that this name should be considered valid, and presumably a synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ag. virescens
</tp:taxon-name>
. As Harris’s (1782) work was focused on the insects of 
England
, 
Warncke (1973)
considered it (as 
<tp:taxon-name>
Apis vitreus
Harris, 1776
</tp:taxon-name>
, from 
England
) a synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Halictus tumulorum
(Linnaeus, 1758)
</tp:taxon-name>
. However, 
Ebmer (1974)
considered Harris’s taxon nomen dubium, indicating that the synonymy of 
Warncke (1973)
was incorrect, and suggested that the large size of 
11.5–12.5 mm
(from 
Ebmer (1974)
, based on Harris’s (1782) mention of “five lines and a half”) and description supported that it was likely a male of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Agapostemon
</tp:taxon-name>
, partially supporting 
Cockerell’s (1921)
opinion. 
Ebmer (1974)
also indicated that it was likely that at the time of collection (i.e., pre-1776), the New 
England
states (where it was presumably collected) were regarded as belonging to the “motherland” (i.e., 
England
), though by the time of publication of Harris’s works (i.e., 1776–1782) the 
United States
was independent. However, as four species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Agapostemon
</tp:taxon-name>
with males generally matching that described by 
Harris (1782)
are found in the New 
England
states, we follow 
Ebmer’s (1974)
recommendation and consider Harris’s species nomen dubium until the 
type
material can be located.
</p>
      <p>
“America” was indicated as the 
type
locality for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ag. virescens
</tp:taxon-name>
by 
Fabricius (1775)
, but the 
type
specimen has seemingly been re-labelled after the fact (i.e., post 
Cresson 1887
) with N[orth]. Amer[ica]. (
Fig. 1
); the specimen was previously examined by 
Cockerell (1921)
and later by Charles D. Michener (as per 
Roberts 1972
) who both considered it a valid representation of this taxon. 
Smith (1853)
considered 
<tp:taxon-name>
Apis virescens
Fabricius 1793
</tp:taxon-name>
(not 1775) a synonym of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Ag. nigricornis
</tp:taxon-name>
, presumably not realizing that the species had been named 18 years previous (though he attributed it to the Banks Collection, as is the 
type
material).
