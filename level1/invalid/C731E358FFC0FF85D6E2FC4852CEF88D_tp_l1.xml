Nervulus (cu-a) strongly postfurcal, distance between basal vein and nervulus 1.0–1.1 times nervulus length. Mediocubital vein (M+CU1) rather evenly and more or less distinctly curved to longitudinal anal vein (1-1A). Brachial (CU1b) vein strongly declivous, oblique to base of wing. Hind wing 4.5–4.6 times longer than its maximum width. First costal abscissa (C+SC+R) 0.9 times as long as second abscissa (1-SC+R). First abscissa of mediocubital vein (M+CU) 0.5–0.6 times as long as second and third abscissae (1-M) combined. Recurrent vein (m-cu) long, sclerotised, pigmented, distinctly antefurcal, straight, oblique towards base of wing.</p>
      <p>LEGS. Hind femur elongate-oval, 2.5–2.7 times longer than wide. Hind tibia with two–three short spines on outer distal margin. Hind tarsus 1.0–1.1 times as long as hind tibia. Hind basitarsus not thickened, 0.7–0.8 times as long as remaining segments combined. Second segment of hind tarsus 0.45–0.50 times as long as basitarsus, 1.3 times longer than narrow fifth segment (without pretarsus).</p>

Propodeum without areas delineated by carinae, entirely densely striate-rugose with reticulation. Hind coxa mainly small and dense rugose-reticulate with punctation, dorsally with few transverse undulate striae; hind femur very densely reticulate-coriaceous. First metasomal tergite entirely densely longitudinally striate with dense reticulation between striae, without distinct dorsal carinae.
