Etymology
</p>
      <p>
The species epithet is derived from the Latin intransitive verb ‘ 
<tp:taxon-name>
spinesco
</tp:taxon-name>
’ (‘grow spiny’), alluding to the spinulose ornamentation on the urosome.

A 
paratype
female specimen (
MABIK
CR00247791) exhibits two abnormal conditions in the P4 enp-1 and P5 exopod. The right leg of the P4 lacks an inner seta on the proximal endopodal segment (
Fig. 12D
, arrowhead) and the left leg of the P5 has four setae on the exopod (
Fig. 10A
, arrowhead). These setal abnormalities were not detected in other examined specimens.

Remarks
</p>
      <p>
Interestingly, this new species exhibits several characteristics intermediate between those of the families 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
. Detailed morphological examination revealed that certain characteristics of the antenna and maxilliped resemble those of idyanthid copepods. The antenna of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Acritozosime spinesco
</tp:taxon-name>
gen. et sp. nov.
shares the presence of two elements on the proximal exopodal segment with the idyanthid genera

</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Tachidiella

</tp:taxon-name>
(all known zosimeid copepods have only one seta); and the distal endopodal segment bears seven elements as in members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
(zosimeid species have at most six setae). The maxilliped of 
<tp:taxon-name>
A
. 
spinesco
</tp:taxon-name>
gen. et sp. nov.
resembles those of idyanthid copepods in the presence of a joint between the syncoxa and basis and the presence of two setae on the syncoxa (members of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
have no setae on that segment, except for 
<tp:taxon-name>
Zosime eliasi
Pointner, 2017
</tp:taxon-name>
having one seta). However, this new taxon also seems to have a close affinity with the family 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
as shown by the following features: (1) the female antennules are short, robust and armed with stout tri-spinulose setae; this is not the case in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
other than 
<tp:taxon-name>
Tachidiella
</tp:taxon-name>
; (2) the distal endopodal segment of the antenna has a lateral armature composed of three elements (vs four setae in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (3) the mandibular endopod has only one lateral seta (vs 2–3 setae as in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Idyanthe
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>
Idyella
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Tachidiella
</tp:taxon-name>
of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (4) the mandibular exopod is one-segmented, with four setae (vs two-segmented, with four setae on proximal segment and two setae on the distal one as in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Styracothorax
</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Tachidiella
</tp:taxon-name>
of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (5) the maxillular exopod is smaller than the endopod (vs longer than the endopod as in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Idyellopsis
</tp:taxon-name>
of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (6) all endites on the maxillary syncoxa are displaced toward the anterior half (vs the praecoxal endite is displaced toward the proximal half as in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Idyella
</tp:taxon-name>
of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (7) the maxilliped has a small and almost square endopod bearing four non-geniculate elements (vs with geniculate setae or strong claws as in 
<tp:taxon-name>
Idyanthe
</tp:taxon-name>
, 
<tp:taxon-name>

and 
<tp:taxon-name>

</tp:taxon-name>
of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); (8) the P1 enp-1 is almost square (vs elongate and broadened at the level of the inner element in the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
); and (9) the shape of the female P5 is similar to that of

, although the number of setae on the exopod differs.

Seifried (2003)
listed four significant autapomorphies of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Idyanthidae</tp:taxon-name>
: (1) the mandibular exopod has a long proximal segment bearing four setae and a small distal segment bearing two setae; (2) the maxillulary exopod is elongate; (3) the P1 enp-1 is elongated and broadened at the level of the inner seta; and (4) the proximal outer seta on the female P5 exopod is inserted near the basis. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Acritozosime spinesco
</tp:taxon-name>
gen. et sp. nov.
does not share these characteristics. Instead, this new species exhibits several autapomorphies of the 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
in the antennary endopod, mandibular both rami, maxillulary exopod, maxillary syncoxa, maxillipedal endopod and P1 endopod as mentioned above (characters 
2–8 in
the previous paragraph). Therefore, we suggest that an allocation of 
<tp:taxon-name>
A
. 
spinesco
</tp:taxon-name>
gen. et sp. nov.
to the 
<tp:taxon-name>Zosimeidae</tp:taxon-name>
is more reasonable; the organism retains certain plesiomorphic conditions (at least in the antenna and maxilliped) of Idyanthidimorpha, as noted above. Within the Idyanthidimorpha, the sexual dimorphism of the male P2 is a clue to the taxonomic position of the harpacticoids (Moura &amp; Martínez Arbizu 2004; 
Bröhldick 2005
). Unfortunately, we could not confirm this character state because we lacked males of the new species.

are the reduced segmentation and setal armature of the thoracic legs. The new species shares the two-segmented endopod in the thoracic legs with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Pseudozosime
</tp:taxon-name>
, but differs from it by the reduced setal armature; the inner element of the proximal endopodal segment is lost in P1–P3; the distal exopodal segment in P2–P4 has two outer spines instead of three. All zosimeid copepods have one or two inner setae on the distal endopodal segment of P1, while these are lacking in
