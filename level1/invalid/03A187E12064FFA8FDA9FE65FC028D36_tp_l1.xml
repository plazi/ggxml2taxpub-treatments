            <p> Redescription </p>
            <p> Similar to <tp:taxon-name> Tachydromia cantabrica </tp:taxon-name> sp. nov. except
                  for the following: </p>
            <p> Male (previously undescribed) </p>
            <p> MEASUREMENTS. Body length: 2.6–2.9 mm (n = 5). Wing length: 0.9–1.1 mm (n = 5). </p>
            <p>HEAD. Ocellar tubercle glabrous. Lateroclinate ocellars 2 times as long as
                  postpedicel. Proclinate verticals 1.8 times as long as postpedicel.</p>
            <p>ANTENNA. Yellow. Postpedicel roundish, as long as wide and, approximately as long as
                  pedicel; stylus almost 4 times as long as scape, pedicel and postpedicel
                  combined.</p>
            <p>PALPUS. About 4 times as long as wide. Yellow in ground colour.</p>
            <p>THORAX. Postpronotal lobe, notopleuron, episternum, anepisternum, sternopleuron,
                  katepimeron and meron weakly differentiated. Scutellum short, postscutellum longer
                  and metanotum well developed. Prosternum and basal half of episternum densely
                  covered by grey microtrichia. Postpronotal lobe bearing 7 setae laterally, 5
                  acrostichal setae, irregularly placed; notopleuron with 1 strong, prominent, very
                  long seta, plus 3 smaller ones</p>
            <p> WING ( Fig. 21B ). Lobed apex oval. Stalk-like portion rigid, yellow to light brown;
                  lobed apex with hyaline cells, veins and distal margin black. Venation very
                  reduced (costal, longitudinal and cross veins distinguishable), forming 4 cells. </p>
            <p> LEGS. Overall yellow, with the following brown to black: dorsal strip on fore and
                  mid femora, posterior coxae, tarsomere 5 of fore and mid-legs, apical portions of
                  tarsomeres 2 and 3, tarsomeres 4 and 5 of hind leg. Mid trochanter with several
                  black anteroventral marginal setae. Mid femur with small roundish posteroventral
                  projection on basal surface with several black denticle-like setae and ca 3 black
                  setae. Mid tibia anteroventral apical spur produced into distinct, long elongation
                  ( Fig. 19C ); slightly longer than diameter of tibia at apex. Spur covered with
                  microtrichia and&gt; 10 short, blunt denticle-like setae; additionally, with 6
                  longer, stout, curved setae along lateral margin. Elongation mostly glabrous with
                  a few setae arising marginally and apically. </p>
            <p>ABDOMEN. Shiny black, with grey microtrichia covering only last tergite and almost
                  all sternites, except for sternites 1 and 2. Tergites and sternites overall
                  covered with setae, except for dorsal surface of all tergites and most of sternite
                  1 (distal margin with a few setae); apical sternite and tergite with longer
                  setae.</p>
            <p> TERMINALIA ( Fig. 12 ). Right surstylus short with irregular margins, narrowing
                  distally, bearing long setae, with several (ca 8) distinct denticle-like setae
                  aggregated on distal margin. Right cercus longer than left. Right cercus with
                  setae on apical ½; left cercus with setae of unequal lengths on apical half and 2
                  long apical setae. Left epandrial lamella ½ shorter than left cercus, with setae
                  of similar length on apical half of ventral surface and on apex of dorsal margin.
                  Left surstylus longer than right cercus, with very long setae on lateral and
                  apical margins. </p>
            <p> Female </p>
            <p> Similar to male, except for following features: stenopterous (length of wing (n =
                  2): 0.7–0.8 mm ), with very minute lobed apex, stalk-like portion yellowish with
                  lobe light brown, covered by grey microtrichia ( Fig. 21C ); legs covered with
                  regular rows of setae, with distinct circle of setae on fore femur and
                  anteroapical setae on coxae; without other distinctive hairs or setae; spurs on
                  mid tibia absent; cercus pale brown with grey microtrichia and setae. </p>
