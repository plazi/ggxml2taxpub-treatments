      <p> Diagnosis </p>
      <p>
         <tp:taxon-name> Sonerila souvannii </tp:taxon-name> sp. nov. is similar to <tp:taxon-name>
            S. cardamomensis </tp:taxon-name> , described from Cambodia , in its acaulescent habit
         and in the shape of its leaves, but it differs in the shape of its rhizome (cylindrical in
            <tp:taxon-name> S. souvanii </tp:taxon-name> vs bulbous in <tp:taxon-name> S.
            cardamomensis </tp:taxon-name> ), larger leaves (8–10 × 6–9 cm vs 1–4 × 0.9–2.7 cm ),
         petiole length and color ( 8–15 cm long and light green vs 0.4–2.5 cm long and reddish
         brown), greater number of flowers per cyme (20–25 vs 5–11), and petal length and pubescence
         (9–10 × 6–7 mm and glabrous vs 5.5–6 × 3.5–4 mm with glandular trichomes on midveins
         abaxially). <tp:taxon-name> Sonerila souvannii </tp:taxon-name> sp. nov. is also similar to
            <tp:taxon-name> S. dongnathamensis </tp:taxon-name> from Thailand in the shape of its
         inflorescences, but differs in the rhizome shape (cylindrical vs globose), the shape of the
         leaf base (cordate vs obtuse to rounded), pedicel length ( 10–25 mm long vs 1–4 mm long),
         the number of flowers per cyme (20–25 vs 5–12), and in the length and outline of the petals
         (9–10 × 6–7 mm , acute vs 3–5 × 3–4 mm , acuminate with long seta). The new species is also
         related to <tp:taxon-name> S. tuberosa </tp:taxon-name> from Cambodia , but distinguished
         in the rhizome shape (cylindrical vs slightly bulbous), the shape of the leaf base (cordate
         vs very broadly ovate to orbicular), pedicel length ( 10–25 mm long vs 5–6 mm long), the
         number of flowers per cyme (20–25 vs 4–8), and in the length and outline of the petals
         (9–10 × 6–7 mm , acute vs 5 × 2.7 mm , elliptic, apiculate, pink) ( Table 2 ). </p>

         <tp:taxon-name> Sonerila souvannii </tp:taxon-name> sp. nov. grows in loose soil in the
         crevices of shaded rocks at 200–210 m a.s.l. It grows in the understorey of lowland

      <p> Preliminary conservation status </p>
      <p> We found three small sub-populations of <tp:taxon-name> S. souvannii </tp:taxon-name> sp.
         nov. with each comprising only 5–6 individuals, about 20 m apart. The species has not yet
         been found anywhere else. Considering the species grows in a very narrowly restricted area
         where human activity, such as collection of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) and the
         logging of wood for local uses, can be seen, we need to pay attention to its conservation.
         As the number of mature individuals is less than 50, we assess this species as Critical
         Endangered (CR) criteria D ( IUCN 2019 ). </p>
