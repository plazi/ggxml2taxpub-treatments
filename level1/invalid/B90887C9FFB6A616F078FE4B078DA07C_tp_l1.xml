            <p> Diagnosis </p>
            <p> The general appearance of <tp:taxon-name> Oreodera kawasae </tp:taxon-name> sp. nov.
                  is much as that of <tp:taxon-name> O. turnbowi McCarty, 2001 </tp:taxon-name> .
                  However, although McCarty (2001) had only provided the length of the holotype male
                  and paratype female, it is possible to see, using photographs of the holotype (see
                  Bezark 2021b ), that <tp:taxon-name> O. turnbowi </tp:taxon-name> is
                  proportionally more slender than <tp:taxon-name> O. kawasae </tp:taxon-name> sp.
                  nov. Additionally, comparing the males of <tp:taxon-name> O. kawasae
                  </tp:taxon-name> sp. nov. with the holotype male of <tp:taxon-name> O. turnbowi
                  </tp:taxon-name> , it is possible to provide the following differences: distance
                  between upper eye lobes equal to maximum width of the scape; antennomeres VII and
                  IX not ringed with white pubescence basally; anterolateral tubercles of the
                  prothorax with apex noticeably rounded; elytra at most 4.0 times prothoracic
                  length; centrobasal crest of the elytra not distinctly separated into two
                  tubercles; tarsomeres V shorter and distinctly widened. In the holotype male of
                        <tp:taxon-name> O. turnbowi </tp:taxon-name> , distance between upper eye
                  lobes shorter than maximum width of scape, antennomeres VII and IX distinctly
                  ringed with whitish pubescence basally, anterolateral tubercles of the prothorax
                  nearly conical, elytra is almost 4.5 times prothoracic length, centrobasal crest
                  of the elytra distinctly separated into two distinct tubercles (with punctures
                  between them), and the tarsomeres V are longer and slender. According to McCarty
                  (2001) , the mesoventral process in <tp:taxon-name> O. turnbowi </tp:taxon-name>
                  is 1.25 times as wide as the mesocoxal cavity. As we do not know where the width
                  was measured (narrowest area or apex), we are not using this difference (in
                        <tp:taxon-name> O. kawasae </tp:taxon-name> sp. nov. , 1.3 times in the
                  narrowest area, 1.5 times in apex). </p>
            <p>
                  <tp:taxon-name> Oreodera kawasae </tp:taxon-name> sp. nov. is also similar to
                        <tp:taxon-name> O. noguerai McCarty, 2001 </tp:taxon-name> , but differs by
                  some of the same characters attributed to <tp:taxon-name> O. turnbowi
                  </tp:taxon-name> (body proportions, pubescence on antennomeres VII and IX.
                  Unfortunately, <tp:taxon-name> O. noguerai </tp:taxon-name> is known only from the
                  holotype female, while <tp:taxon-name> O. kawasae </tp:taxon-name> sp. nov. is
                  known only from males, but it also differs by the antennomere III being about 0.7
                  times as long as scape (twice as long as scape in <tp:taxon-name> O. noguerai
                  </tp:taxon-name> ), and apical half of elytral margin without a fringe of sparse,
                  fine, erect setae (present in <tp:taxon-name> O. noguerai </tp:taxon-name> ). </p>
            <p> The general appearance of <tp:taxon-name> O. kawasae </tp:taxon-name> sp. nov. is
                  somewhat similar to that of <tp:taxon-name> O. advena Martins &amp; Galileo, 2005
                  </tp:taxon-name> , <tp:taxon-name> O. basipenicillata Tippmann, 1960
                  </tp:taxon-name> , <tp:taxon-name> O. undulata Bates, 1861 </tp:taxon-name> , and
                        <tp:taxon-name> O. clarkei Galileo, Santos-Silva &amp; Wappes, 2017
                  </tp:taxon-name> (see photographs of these four species on Bezark 2021b ), but
                  differs from them especially by the elytral pubescence pattern, and protarsal
                  length and shape. </p>

            <p> This species is named after Blanca Jeannette Kawas Fernández (Jeanette Kawas for
                  short) in honor of her never-ending efforts to conserve the fauna and flora of
                  Honduras . She co-established the Prolansate Foundation, which is still committed
                  to protecting the environment while improving the quality of life of the local
                  communities. Jeanette was murdered at her home in February 1995 . </p>

                  near posterior margin, coarse, moderately abundant punctures near anterior margin

                  club, and small pale yellow pubescent spots between it and apex. Tibiae with light
                  yellowish-brown pubescent ring on basal third (protibiae) or quarter (meso- and
                  metatibiae), ring with yellowish-white pubescence centrally, ring with sparse
                  brownish pubescence between previous rings, sparse brownish pubescence dorsally
                  and laterally on posterior quarter, bristly yellowish-brown pubescence ventrally
                  on posterior quarter; posterior quarter of ventral surface of protibiae sinuous,
                  with distinct projection on base of this area; dorsal surface of posterior quarter
                  of meso- and metatibiae with short, erect, thick black setae dorsally. Protarsi
                  not noticeably long; inner side of tarsomere II with distinct projection ( Fig. 17
                  ). Tarsomeres I–II with pale yellow pubescence; tarsomeres III–V with brownish
                  pubescence, shorter and sparser than on anterior segments; metatarsomere I
                  slightly longer than II–III together. </p>
            <p>ABDOMEN. Ventrites with yellowish pubescence, partially obscuring integument, denser
                  laterally, except glabrous apex of I–IV; apex of ventrite V rounded (slightly more
                  projected centrally).</p>
            <p> Variation ( Figs 18–19 ) </p>
            <p>Pubescence on vertex moderately greenish-brown; dense yellow pubescence on scutellum
                  from covering almost entire surface to present only at apex; elytral pubescence
                  somewhat variable, especially shape of white pubescent bands, and number of
                  brownish subcircular areas, which may be very distinct, almost forming oblique
                  band close to arms of Y-shaped white pubescent band, and posterior area of central
                  white pubescent band.</p>
            <p> Sequence information </p>
            <p> A specimen from CNP of this species has been sequenced by the Centre for
                  Biodiversity Genomics (CBG) as part of a separate project ( D’Souza &amp; Hebert
                  2018 , project doi: https://doi.org/10.5883/DS-MECNP), but until now it has
                  remained unidentified. The sequence (Cytochrome Oxidase Subunit 1 5’ Region) can
                  be accessed through the BOLDSystems database, with ID number GMHGE319-13. </p>

            <p> Remarks </p>
            <p>Apparently, the new species is somewhat common. Therefore, it is likely that there
                  are many specimens incorrectly identified in the collections.</p>
