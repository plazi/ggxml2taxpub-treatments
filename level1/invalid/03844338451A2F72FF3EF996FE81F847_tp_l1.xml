      <p> The specimens bear red labels specifying that the identification was made from comparison
         with Thomson’s material in Lund. We studied two females in Aubert’s collection and, after
         comparison with <tp:taxon-name> C. difformis </tp:taxon-name> in Horstmann’s collection, we
         think they are likely <tp:taxon-name> C. unicingulatus </tp:taxon-name> as they have the
         epicnemial carina evenly raised ventrally and submedially, propodeum with the area
         superomedia and area petiolaris only slightly depressed and with fine transverse striae
         starting from the base of the area petiolaris, and an ovipositor ratio of 1.5–1.6
         (ovipositor ratio slightly exceeding that stated for <tp:taxon-name> C. unicingulatus
         </tp:taxon-name> ). In our opinion, this misidentification could be the reason that led
         Aubert to reject Horstmann’s interpretation of <tp:taxon-name> mutabilis </tp:taxon-name>
         as a synonym of <tp:taxon-name> difformis </tp:taxon-name> . </p>
