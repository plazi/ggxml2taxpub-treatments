Comparative diagnosis

      <p>
This new subspecies is very similar to the trans-tropical 
<tp:taxon-name>
Hemidoryctes carbonarius carbonarius
(Ashmead, 1894)
</tp:taxon-name>
, but differs from it by the distinctly postfurcal position of the fore wing recurrent vein
</p>
      <p>
(m-cu) (always antefurcal in 

H. c.

) and recorded only in 
Yemen
(with wide pantropical distribution for 

H. c.

Nervulus (cu-a) strongly postfurcal, distance from nervulus (cu-a) to basal vein (1-M) 1.6–2.0 times nervulus (cu-a) length. Brachial (subdiscal) cell open apically, but present short brachial vein (CU1b). Parallel vein (CU1a) weakly curved basally. Hind wing 5.0–5.2 times longer than wide. First abscissa of costal vein (C+SC+R)about as long as second abscissa. Medial (basal) cell rather narrow, weakly widened posteriorly, 11.0–13.0 times longer than wide, 0.4 times as long as hind wing. First abscissa of mediocubital vein (1-SC+R) 0.6 times as long as second abscissa (2-SC+R). Recurrent vein (m-cu) straight, oblique to base of wing, interstitial, sclerotised.</p>
