Description
(
Figs 38–39
)
</p>
      <p>HEAD. Head weakly transverse. Ocelli arranged in triangle with base larger than its sides. Frons flat and without median keel. Eyes with sparse and short setae. Occipital carina distinct dorsally, obliterated below at short distance and not fused with hypostomal carina. Malar suture absent. Clypeal suture distinct and complete. Clypeus with short and fine ventral flange. Hypoclypeal depression round. Postgenal bridge narrow. Palps relatively short; maxillary palps 6-segmented, labial palps 4-segmented; third segment of labial palps not shortened. Scapus rather wide and long, without apical lobe. First flagellar segment subcylindrical, almost straight, almost as long as second segment.</p>
      <p>MESOSOMA. Pronotum dorsally flat, pronotal keel distinct. Mesonotum not highly, gently roundly elevated above pronotum, entirely finely reticulate-granulate. Notauli entirely shallow and fine. Prescutellar depression rather short, with median carina. Scuto-scutellar suture present and distinct. Metanotal tooth almost absent. Sternaulus (precoxal furrow) shallow, long, sculptured. Prepectal carina distinct and complete. Postpectal carina absent. Propodeum with areas mostly delineated by distinct carinae in basal half and fine carinae in apical half, areola narrow; lateral tubercles absent; propodeal bridge absent; spiracles small and round.</p>
      <p>LEGS. Fore and middle tibiae with slender several spines arranged in single row. Hind coxa with distinct basoventral corner and basoventral tooth. All femora with fine dorsal protuberances. Hind basitarsus almost 0.5 times as long as second–fifth segments combined.</p>
      <p>WINGS. Pterostigma of fore wing narrow; radial vein (r) arising from middle of pterostigma. Radial (marginal) cell rather distinctly shortened. Second radiomedial vein (r-m) absent. Recurrent vein (mcu) weakly postfurcal or almost interstitial. Nervulus (cu-a) postfurcal. Discoidal (discal) cell long petiolate. Parallel vein (CU1a) interstitial. Brachial (subdiscal) cell closed at level of recurrent vein (m-cu). Hind wing with three hamuli. Nervellus (cu-a) present. Medial (basal) cell narrow, but weakly widened posteriorly. Submedial (subbasal) cell rather short; first abscissa of mediocubital vein (M+CU) 0.6 times as long as second abscissa (1-M). Recurrent vein (m-cu) present, but transparent.</p>
      <p>METASOMA. First metasomal tergite not petiolate, relatively long and wide, moveably fused with second tergite. Acrosternite 0.15–0.20 times as long as first tergite, its apical margin situated distinctly before level of spiracles; dorsope of first tergite absent; spiracular tubercles small, dorsal carinae distinct, complete and strongly convergent basally; basolateral lobes absent. Second suture deep, almost straight, without lateral bends. Second tergite often with fine subbasal transverse furrow, with apical narrow area delineated anteriorly by deep and rather wide furrow. Present five visible tergites. Second–sixth tergites with separate laterotergites. Fourth and fifth tergite with distinct and crenulate subbasal transverse furrows. Fifth tergite of female enlarged, larger than previous tergite, almost concealed by the succeeding segments, entirely sculptured. Ovipositor much shorter than metasoma.</p>

Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>
This genus is morphologically similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Rhaconotus
Ruthe, 1854
</tp:taxon-name>
but differs from the latter genus mainly by the missing second radiomedial vein (r-m) and second radiomedial (submarginal) cell of fore wing.

         <tp:taxon-name>
Pseudorhaconotus
</tp:taxon-name>
is a morphologically distinctive monotypic genus that was originally described from southern 
Spain
(
van Achterberg &amp; Shaw 2010
). This is one of the two 
<tp:taxon-name>Rhaconotini</tp:taxon-name>
genera (together with Malagasy 
<tp:taxon-name>
Grangerdoryctes
Belokobylskij, 2005
</tp:taxon-name>
) that does not have the second radiomedial vein (r-m) and second radiomedial (submarginal) cell. The position of this genus within 
<tp:taxon-name>Rhaconotini</tp:taxon-name>
is supported by its enlarged fifth metasomal tergite, which almost covers the following segments, the separated laterotergites on the fifth metasomal tergite, interstitial position of parallel vein (CU1a) in fore wing, postfurcal position of recurrent vein (m-cu), and densely granulate-reticulate head and mesosoma.
