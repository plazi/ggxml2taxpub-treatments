Description
</p>
      <p>Carapace sub-triangular in lateral view with asymmetric valves and overlap of LV all around RV with maximum along DB; lateral surface smooth.</p>
      <p>LV: Hmax around mid-L; dorsal margin uniformly convex with PDB and ADB almost straight; AB with small radius of curvature located above mid-H; VB straight to only gently concave; PB narrow with maximum of convexity located very ventrally.</p>
      <p>RV: Hmax located at AD angulation; DB long and straight, gently bent posteriorly; PDB straight with terminal concavity; ADB concave; PD angle (130–135°) and AD angle (135–140°) laterally compressed; AB with relatively small radius of curvature, located above mid-H; oral concavity in front of mid-L at ventral margin; PB slighted.</p>

Remarks

      <p>
         <tp:taxon-name>
Bairdia girtyi
Sohn, 1960
sensu 
Hoare &amp; Merrill, 2004
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Pennsylvanian of 
Texas
(
Hoare &amp; Merrill 2004
) is similar to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bairdia elcapitanensis
</tp:taxon-name>
sp. nov.
by its lateral morphology, but lacks the AD and PD angulations at RV. It is worth noting that the specimens of 
Hoare &amp; Merrill (2004)
do not belong to 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bairdia girtyi
Sohn, 1960
</tp:taxon-name>
from the Late Mississippian of 
USA
(
Sohn 1960
), because 
<tp:taxon-name>
Bairdia girtyi
</tp:taxon-name>
is more elongate, with PB located higher and Hmax located slightly behind mid-H.
