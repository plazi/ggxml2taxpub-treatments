Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>
Based in part on 

Miranda
&amp; Reboleira (2019)

, this species may be separated from other species of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Sarax
</tp:taxon-name>
in Southeast Asia and Oceania by the following combination of characters: large size (total length 
12.82 mm
); eight anterior setae; only two pairs of lateral eyes; cheliceral claw with six teeth; male gonopod with base of fistula, dorsal lobe and lateral lobe II sclerotized; pedipalp tarsus with two dorsal spines; leg basitibia with four pseudo-articles; leg IV distitibia 
sc
and 
sf
series each with six trichobothria.
</p>
      <p>
The presence of only two pairs of lateral eyes is a unique character state among 
<tp:taxon-name>Amblypygi</tp:taxon-name>
, otherwise known only in a few extinct species, e.g., 
<tp:taxon-name>
Kronocharon longicalcaris

</tp:taxon-name>
and 
<tp:taxon-name>
Paracharonopsis cambayensis
Engel &amp; Grimaldi, 2014
</tp:taxon-name>
. 
<tp:taxon-name>
Sarax timorensis
</tp:taxon-name>
differs from these species by its much larger size and the number of spines on the pedipalp. The female is unknown.

Natural history
</p>
      <p>
The cave in which the 
type
material was collected is on the border of Ira Lalaro Lake, a large closed karst depression in the eastern part of Timor Island. The temperature in the cave is constant at about 32°C and a stream runs through it. A large bat colony contributes extensive guano deposits, resulting in high densities of cockroaches throughout the cave.
