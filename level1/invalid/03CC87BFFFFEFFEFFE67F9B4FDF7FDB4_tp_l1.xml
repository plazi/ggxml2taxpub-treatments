Description
</p>
      <p>
Holotype
MB.C.29894 (
Fig. 35A
) is a fairly well-preserved specimen with 
80 mm
conch diameter. It shows, at a conch diameter of 
60 mm
, three closely approximated septa, after which the terminal body chamber begins with a sudden weakening of the ventrolateral nodes. While these nodes are coarse and conical on the phragmocone, they almost spontaneously become elongated and hook-shaped on the body chamber.
</p>
      <p>
The suture line of 
holotype
MB.C.29894 shows a deep, parallel-sided external lobe with prongs multiply serrated asymmetrically (
Fig. 35C
). The ventrolateral saddle is nearly symmetric and inverted U-shaped, it is followed by an adventive lobe and a lateral lobe with six little notches each. Both lobes are semicircular at the base and slightly asymmetric.
</p>
      <p>
Paratype
MB.C.29880 has 
83 mm
conch diameter; half of the last volution belongs to the body chamber (
Fig. 35B
). It largely agrees, in conch shape and sculpture, with the 
holotype
. The specimen allows for the study of two whorls, on which transformations in conch shape and sculpture can be observed. The phragmocone has a nearly circular whorl profile (ww/wh about 1.15 at 
60 mm
conch diameter) with nine coarse conical ventrolateral nodes on its last volution, which sometimes are developed as sharp spines. On the body chamber, the transformation into a weakly trapezoidal whorl profile can be observed; here the slightly concave flanks diverge towards the subangular ventrolateral shoulder that separates the flank from the flattened, weakly tectiform venter. On the body chamber occurs also a change in the sculpture towards more numerous (about 10 per half whorl) short ribs, which are restricted to the outer flank and ventrally end in hook-shaped, sharp nodes.
</p>
      <p>
Paratype
MB.C.29900 is a specimen of 
104 mm
conch diameter. It has a fairly well-preserved phragmocone but a weathered body chamber, of which a little more than half a volution is preserved (
Fig. 36A
). The shape of the body chamber whorl profile had to be reconstructed; it shows a trapezoidal shape with weakly diverging flanks, a rounded ventrolateral shoulder and a flattened tectiform venter. One volution earlier, the whorl profile is strongly trapezoidal with flat, diverging flanks and a flattened, broadly rounded venter. The sculpture is coarse on the phragmocone and weakens in strength significantly on the body chamber. The last volution of the phragmocone has 15 conical, spiny ventrolateral nodes, which are first very coarse and conical but later elongate, weaker and more closely spaced. On the body chamber, weak and rounded ribs with concave course are visible on the outer flank.

Description
</p>
            <p>
Specimen MB.C.29932 is a nicely preserved specimen of 
72 mm
conch diameter (
Fig. 38A
). It shows weak septal crowding at 
48 mm
diameter and thus half of the last volution belongs to the body chamber. The whorl profile shape changes from trapezoidal with convex flanks of the subadult stage to parallelsided at the beginning of the body chamber; at the same time the shape of the venter changes from weakly convex to nearly totally flattened. The sculpture of the subadult stage possesses 13 conical ventrolateral nods per volution; they originate from rounded radial ribs. On the body chamber the nodes are weaker and become radially elongated, they are connected with low, rounded dorsolateral ribs.
</p>
            <p>
The suture line of specimen MB.C.29932 shows an asymmetric external lobe with weakly concave flanks, of which both prongs are trifid. Also on the venter follows the very narrow, weakly inflated ventrolateral saddle and the asymmetric adventive lobe (
Fig. 38B
).
</p>
            <p>
Specimen MB.C.29933 is a larger specimen with 
101 mm
conch diameter (
Fig. 39A
). It shows similar conch and sculpture characteristics but differs from the preceding specimen in the coarser ventrolateral nods and the larger phragmocone (
62 mm
dm). Its suture line has a parallel-sided external lobe with parallel-sided trifid prongs. The ventrolateral saddle is very narrow and the adventive lobe shows strong serration by small notches, which climb up the ventral flank to more than half of the lobe depth. The lateral saddle is weakly inflated and lower than the ventrolateral saddle and the lateral lobe is nearly parallel-sided and possesses five small notches (
Fig. 39B
).

Description

                  <p>
Specimen MB.C.29936 has 
62 mm
conch diameter and is the largest available specimen (
Fig. 40A
). It is corroded but still rather well preserved and allows the study of three whorls. A little more than half a volution belongs to the body chamber. The weakly depressed whorl profile (ww/wh = 1.05) of the body chamber is trapezoidal with weakly diverging flanks and the flattened venter is separated from the flanks by a subangular ventrolateral shoulder. The sculpture changes, on the last portion of the phragmocone, from a subadult stage with 14 coarse ventrolateral nodes per volution to the adult stage with numerous weak radial ribs with weak ventrolateral nodes on the flank.

Specimen MB.C.29934 is a smaller individual with 
48 mm
conch diameter and is better preserved than the preceding one with half a volution of the body chamber preserved (
Fig. 40B
). It shows a weakly trapezoidal, weakly depressed body chamber whorl profile (ww/wh=1.05) with rounded ventrolateral shoulder and a broadly rounded venter, while the phragmocone has a more depressed whorl profile (ww/ wh= 1.40). The sculpture in the subadult stage has twelve coarse ventrolateral nodes, which become weaker and radially elongated on the body chamber, where they finally disappear and instead shallow radial dorsolateral ribs take place.
</p>
                  <p>
The suture line of specimen MB.C.29934 has an external lobe with nearly parallel flanks and unserrated, narrow lanceolate prongs. The ventrolateral saddle is weakly asymmetric and the adventive lobe is strongly asymmetric with a steep ventral flank, four little notches and an oblique dorsal side. The lateral lobe possesses only three small notches (
Fig. 40D
).

Description
</p>
      <p>
Specimen MB.C.29932 is a nicely preserved specimen of 
72 mm
conch diameter (
Fig. 38A
). It shows weak septal crowding at 
48 mm
diameter and thus half of the last volution belongs to the body chamber. The whorl profile shape changes from trapezoidal with convex flanks of the subadult stage to parallelsided at the beginning of the body chamber; at the same time the shape of the venter changes from weakly convex to nearly totally flattened. The sculpture of the subadult stage possesses 13 conical ventrolateral nods per volution; they originate from rounded radial ribs. On the body chamber the nodes are weaker and become radially elongated, they are connected with low, rounded dorsolateral ribs.
</p>
      <p>
The suture line of specimen MB.C.29932 shows an asymmetric external lobe with weakly concave flanks, of which both prongs are trifid. Also on the venter follows the very narrow, weakly inflated ventrolateral saddle and the asymmetric adventive lobe (
Fig. 38B
).
</p>
      <p>
Specimen MB.C.29933 is a larger specimen with 
101 mm
conch diameter (
Fig. 39A
). It shows similar conch and sculpture characteristics but differs from the preceding specimen in the coarser ventrolateral nods and the larger phragmocone (
62 mm
dm). Its suture line has a parallel-sided external lobe with parallel-sided trifid prongs. The ventrolateral saddle is very narrow and the adventive lobe shows strong serration by small notches, which climb up the ventral flank to more than half of the lobe depth. The lateral saddle is weakly inflated and lower than the ventrolateral saddle and the lateral lobe is nearly parallel-sided and possesses five small notches (
Fig. 39B
).

Specimen MB.C.29934 is a smaller individual with 
48 mm
conch diameter and is better preserved than the preceding one with half a volution of the body chamber preserved (
Fig. 40B
). It shows a weakly trapezoidal, weakly depressed body chamber whorl profile (ww/wh=1.05) with rounded ventrolateral shoulder and a broadly rounded venter, while the phragmocone has a more depressed whorl profile (ww/ wh= 1.40). The sculpture in the subadult stage has twelve coarse ventrolateral nodes, which become weaker and radially elongated on the body chamber, where they finally disappear and instead shallow radial dorsolateral ribs take place.
</p>
            <p>
The suture line of specimen MB.C.29934 has an external lobe with nearly parallel flanks and unserrated, narrow lanceolate prongs. The ventrolateral saddle is weakly asymmetric and the adventive lobe is strongly asymmetric with a steep ventral flank, four little notches and an oblique dorsal side. The lateral lobe possesses only three small notches (
Fig. 40D
).

Description
</p>
      <p>
Specimen MB.C.29936 has 
62 mm
conch diameter and is the largest available specimen (
Fig. 40A
). It is corroded but still rather well preserved and allows the study of three whorls. A little more than half a volution belongs to the body chamber. The weakly depressed whorl profile (ww/wh = 1.05) of the body chamber is trapezoidal with weakly diverging flanks and the flattened venter is separated from the flanks by a subangular ventrolateral shoulder. The sculpture changes, on the last portion of the phragmocone, from a subadult stage with 14 coarse ventrolateral nodes per volution to the adult stage with numerous weak radial ribs with weak ventrolateral nodes on the flank.
