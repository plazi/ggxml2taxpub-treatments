</p>
      <p>
STIGMATIC PLATES. First stigmatic plate triangular, apex well rounded, nearly as wide as at base, slightly turned towards coxa. Hairs most abundant on apical margin, very few hairs on basal and lateral margins (
Fig. 8C
).
</p>
      <p>PLEURITES. First pleurite slightly extending posteriorly in a well-rounded process.</p>
      <p>COLLUM. Margins covered with a few short hairs, central part glabrous.</p>
      <p>THORACIC SHIELD. Surface like those of tergites, glabrous.</p>
      <p>TERGITES. Smooth and glabrous, no small pits present. Paratergites projecting slightly posteriorly.</p>
      <p>
ENDOTERGUM. Inner section with numerous short spines and isolated bristles. Between marginal ridge and inner area, a single row of sparse large, circular cuticular impressions. Externally one or two rows of marginal bristles, standing irregularly to each other. Bristles scaly, of medium length, longest reaching slightly above tergite margin (
Fig. 5D
).
</p>
      <p>ANAL SHIELD. Rounded, neither bell-shaped nor tapered, glabrous. Ventral side of anal shield with two black locking carinae, located close to laterotergites. Anterior carina small, posterior carina 2–3 times as long as anterior carina.</p>
      <p>
LEGS. Leg 1 with 6 or 7 ventral spines, leg 2 with 8, leg 3 with 10. First two leg pairs without an apical spine, spine present on leg 3. Leg pairs 4–21 with 9 or 10 ventral spines and an apical spine. On leg 9, femur 2 and tarsus 4.9 times as long as wide. All podomeres with setae (
Fig. 8A
).
</p>
      <p>
Male sexual characters
</p>
      <p>
GONOPORE. Covered with a single undivided, rounded membranous plate, covering ¼ of surface of coxa. Gonopore located centrally on joint (
Fig. 8B
).
</p>
      <p>
ANTERIOR TELOPODS. Harp with two stridulation ribs, mesal rib smaller than lateral one, both ribs well developed (
Fig. 8F
). First podomere 1.2 times as wide as long. Second podomere process lobe-like and slightly curved, with rounded edges, protruding up to half of third podomere height, apically with sclerotized spots. Third podomere long, as long as first; cavity mesally with numerous sclerotized spots and three thin, sclerotized spines; one sclerotized spot located close to tip. Podomeres 1–3 covered on both sides with numerous long, isolated hairs.
</p>
      <p>
POSTERIOR TELOPODS. Movable finger with a well-rounded tip, not tapering towards tip; hollowed-out inner margin with one non-sclerotized lobe and 3 or 4 sclerotized spines, posterior aspect with ca 14 small sclerotized teeth. Movable finger slightly longer than fixed finger, the latter straight, as wide as third podomere. Fixed finger at margin with numerous sclerotized spots. All podomeres covered on both sides with numerous, long isolated hairs, only tips of chela glabrous (
Fig. 8G–H
).

sp. nov.
is currently known only from the dry forest of Beanka (
Fig. 3
). With most known dry forest giant pill-millipede species being widespread (
Wesener &amp; Wägele 2008
; Wesener 2009), this species can be expected in surrounding dry forest fragments.
