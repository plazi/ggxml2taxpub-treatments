            <p> This species may be separated from other <tp:taxon-name> Charinus </tp:taxon-name>
                  in eastern South America by means of the following combination of characters:
                  metasternum without anterior setae in membranous region, but with four setae
                  posteriorly; two small, flat teeth in retrolateral row of basal cheliceral
                  segment; cheliceral claw with five teeth; pedipalp femur with setiferous tubercle
                  proximal to ventral spine 1, i.e., between spine 1 and proximal margin; tibia of
                  leg I with 21 articles, tarsus I with 37 articles; leg IV distal apex of
                  basitibial pseudo-articles without dark, denticulate projection; distitibia with
                  two pseudo-articles; trichobothrium bt situated in proximal third. </p>
            <p> This species resembles <tp:taxon-name> C. ricardoi </tp:taxon-name> , but differs in
                  the count of ventral spines on the pedipalp: three ventral spines are present in
                        <tp:taxon-name> C. monasticus </tp:taxon-name> sp. nov. , compared with four
                  in <tp:taxon-name> C. ricardoi </tp:taxon-name> . The male is unknown. </p>
