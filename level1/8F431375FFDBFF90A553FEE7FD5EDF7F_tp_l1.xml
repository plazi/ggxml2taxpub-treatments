Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>
Based on 
Quintero (1986)
, this species may be separated from other 
<tp:taxon-name>
Charinus
</tp:taxon-name>
in Amazonia and northern South America by means of the following combination of characters: carapace, pedipalps and femora of walking legs uniformly pale blackish; clavate setae, with some short, acuminate setae on carapace, pedipalps and abdominal tergites; median eyes and median ocular tubercle absent; lateral eyes well developed; basal segment of chelicera without tooth on side of bifid tooth; bifid tooth with dorsal cusp longer than ventral; pedipalp femur with four dorsal spines; pedipalp patella with four dorsal spines; pedipalp tarsus with two small dorsal spines; tibia of leg I with 23 articles, tarsus I with 37 articles; leg IV basitibia with two pseudo-articles; trichobothrium

equidistant between 
bf
and

Natural history
</p>
      <p>
The 
paratypes
from 
Guyana
were collected inside an ant nest, a remarkable environment, unusual for whip spiders (
Quintero 1986
). This species was collected in sympatry with 
<tp:taxon-name>
Heterophrynus alces
Pocock, 1902

Remarks
</p>
      <p>
Quintero (1986: 209)
described the pedipalp spines as follows. Initially, he noted “femur, ventral border with five spines” but went on to describe the position of the five dorsal spines (Fd-1–5), not the ventral spines. 
Quintero (1986: 209)
subsequently noted the count of dorsal spines on the pedipalp patella as “dorsal border of tibia with five spines,” followed by details of the position and size of these spines “Td-1 very small and displaced ventrally.” This leads to the conclusion that 
Quintero (1986: 209)
was consistently referring to the dorsal spines of the femur, not the ventral spines, and did not describe any details of spines on the ventral border of the femur.
</p>
      <p>
Considering that 
Quintero (1986)
was referring to the dorsal spines on the femur, it is probable that 
<tp:taxon-name>
C. quinteroi
</tp:taxon-name>
possesses four dorsal spines, not five. This is because 
Quintero (1986)
mentioned that “the first spine is very small (the 
paratypes
possess a setiferous tubercle in its place, slightly displaced dorsally).” Two or three setiferous tubercles are always situated proximal to the first spine, their position varying from dorsally to frontally, depending on the species.
</p>
      <p>
The number of spines on the pedipalp patella also differs from the original description, as 
Quintero (1986)
included the long distal setiferous tubercle in the count of dorsal spines, resulting in five, rather than the true count of four dorsal spines.
