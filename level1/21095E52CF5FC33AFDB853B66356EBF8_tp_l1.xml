            <p> Remarks </p>
            <p> Most of the specimens of <tp:taxon-name> Ceratobairdia wordensis ( Hamilton, 1942 )
                  </tp:taxon-name> in the present work occur as isolated valves and LV are
                  relatively easily assigned to this species based on their unique dorsal
                  ornamentation. The identification of RV is more complex and has been possible
                  because of the description provided by Hamilton (1942: 716) of “the centrodorsal
                  portion of the right valve flattens abruptly to hingeline, expressed as a flat
                  terrace in dorsal bi and as a rather prominent ridge in lateral view; […]; the
                  ventral portion of the right valve sharply infolded, forming a sharp downward
                  projecting ridge terminating in mature molds as a backward projecting spine.” </p>
            <p> Hamilton (1942: 716) described the dorsal margin of LV of <tp:taxon-name>
                        Ceratobairdia wordensis </tp:taxon-name> as “usually ornamented by two to
                  seven short strong spines equally spaced and concentrated dorsally on the middle
                  third or more.” The present material provided LV with 4 to 6 spines, but all other
                  characters leave no doubt on the conspecificity of the specimens. Is the number of
                  spines related to ontogeny? Although Hamilton (1942) mentioned 2 to 7 dorsal
                  spines on LV, the unique specimen illustrated displays 6 spines and no discussion
                  is provided on the possible link between size and number of the spines.
                  Conversely, Sohn (1960 : pl. 4 figs 12, 14, 17) illustrated specimens with 8 to 10
                  dorsal spines and at least one of them shows spines organized into 2 overlapping
                  rows. For the present material, the number of spines along the dorsal margin of LV
                  of <tp:taxon-name> Ceratobairdia wordensis </tp:taxon-name> ranges from 4 to 6
                  without pattern related to ontogeny ( Fig. 10 ): </p>

                        Hamilton, 1942 ) </tp:taxon-name> from the Middle Permian (Roadian,
                  Capitanian) of the Guadalupe Mountains (West Texas, USA). Top: left valves (arrows
                  pointing to dorsal spines), bottom: right valves. </p>
            <p>• most of the smallest specimens, assigned to A-2?, are weathered but the two
                  sufficiently well preserved at dorsal margin show 5 spines, the 2 external being
                  ‘embryonic’,</p>
            <p>• the only known specimen of A-1? stage displays 4 dorsal spines,</p>
            <p>• the adult specimens display from 4 to 6 spines, the external ones being the
                  smallest.</p>
            <p> It is worth noting that in A-2? specimens, the external spines are very small and
                  may be overlooked, leading to the wrong identification of only 3 dorsal spines.
                  However, these specimens cannot be confused with Petasobairdia tricornuta Chen in
                  Shi &amp; Chen, 2002 from the Late Permian of South China ( Shi &amp; Chen 2002 )
                  which is more elongate, larger, and with only 3 spines for specimens of a size
                  slightly larger than the adults of <tp:taxon-name> Ceratobairdia wordensis
                  </tp:taxon-name> . </p>
            <p> A significant morphological trend is observed in <tp:taxon-name> Ceratobairdia
                        wordensis </tp:taxon-name> from the Guadalupe Mountains: whereas the
                  majority of specimens have a relatively smooth surface, several show the
                  development of scattered nodules in the dorsal area of their lateral surface (
                  Fig. 9O–Q ). This trend culminates in very rare specimens with the entire lateral
                  surface of the valves covered by nodules ( Fig. 9R ). This nodular surface is
                  reminiscent of <tp:taxon-name> Pustulobairdia Sohn, 1960 </tp:taxon-name> but all
                  characters of <tp:taxon-name> Ceratobairdia wordensis </tp:taxon-name> and the
                  morphological trend observed from smooth to nodular leave no doubt that these
                  specimens belong to <tp:taxon-name> Ceratobairdia wordensis </tp:taxon-name> .
