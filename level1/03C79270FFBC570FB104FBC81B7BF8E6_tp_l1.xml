      <p> Description </p>
      <p> The species was collected and described from Zanzibar , Tanzania , at the African east
         coast. No type or topotype specimens were available for the present study. The species has
         not been collected since its description, hence, the present notes are a summary of
         taxonomically relevant information extracted from Zelinka (1913 , 1928 ). </p>
      <p> Small <tp:taxon-name> Echinoderes </tp:taxon-name> , with a trunk length of 228 µm , and
         lateral terminal spines reaching ¾ of trunk length. Very short middorsal spines present on
         segments 4 to 8, not even reaching the pectinate fringes of posterior segment margins, and
         lateroventral spines on segments 6 to 9. Tubes present in lateroventral positions on
         segments 2 and 5, and in laterodorsal positions on 10. The presence of glandular cell
         outlets type 2 in laterodorsal positions on segments 8 and/or 9 are not mentioned in the
         description, but they could possibly be present. Tergal extensions of segment are 11 short,
         pointed and well-spaced, and sternal extensions rounded, with ventrolateral seta-like tuft
         of extended fringe tips. Females with lateral terminal accessory spines. The presence of
         ventromedial female papillae is not mentioned in the description, but they could possibly
         be present in ventromedial or ventrolateral positions on some sternal plates. </p>
