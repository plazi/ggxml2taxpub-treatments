Diagnosis
</p>
      <p>Head with a dark brown central spot subdivided by the lighter M-line. Male tergum 9 with a slender nailshaped median sclerite, having a slightly enlarged tip. Aedeagal tube with a fishtail-shaped sclerotized dorsobasal marking. Aedeagal sac straight, dorsomedially with two differently sized membranous lobes, and apically with a membranous lobe bearing a long median spine and two shorter lateral spines. Posterior margin of female sternum 8 barely produced, forming a small triangular subgenital plate. Eggs dark brown, teardrop-shaped with long and slender collar, and petiolate anchor.</p>

      <p>
Male
(complementary description)
</p>
      <p>
ADULT HABITUS (
Fig. 11A
). General color pale brown. Forewing length ca 
9.5 mm
, hindwing length ca 
8.3 mm
. Head pale brown, with a dark brown central spot subdivided by the lighter M-line; biocellate, ocelli about twice the diameter apart of each other, but still closer to each other than to the compound eye; antennal scape brown, flagellum brownish. Pronotum pale brown, trapezoidal, with obscure darker rugosities and midline; anterior corners pointed but posterior corners obtuse. Legs brown but basal half of femora pale brown; wings subhyaline and yellowish brown, veins brown, Sc of forewing short, typical of the genus; cerci pale.
</p>
      <p>
ABDOMEN (
Fig. 11B–D
). Sterna 3–5 with hair brushes. Dark median process of tergum 9 sclerotized, slender nail-shaped, about 3 times as long as wide, and slightly enlarged on posterior margin; posterior portion covered by several tiny, brown warts. Hemitergal processes slender, about 2.5× as long as basal width, with a pointed tip; triangular in lateral view; basal callus with patch of sensilla basiconica.

AEDEAGUS (
Fig. 12
). Aedeagal tube partially sclerotized dorsobasally, forming a fishtail-shaped marking. Fully everted sac as long as the tube, straight; a large and a small membranous lobe located in dorsomedial portion, their apex points to the base and tip of the aedeagus, respectively; ventroapical surface with a slightly swollen and sclerotized area, distinct in lateral view; a basally sclerotized but mostly membranous apical lobe bears a long spine about as long as ¼ aedeagus length.

EGG (
Figs 13D–F
, 
14
). Length 482–539 μm, width 226–232 μm (N = 5). Several mature eggs were dissected from female terminalia. Teardrop-shaped with long, slender collar and petiolate anchor. Anchor mushroom-shaped with marginal rows of globular bodies, pedicle stalked and hidden by anchor plate. Collar elongated and slender, with a short, flanged rim. Chorion dark brown, covered with fine punctuations. Micropylar orifices sessile, much larger than punctuations, set on subequatorial line.

Remarks
</p>
      <p>
The Chinese specimens are similar to the original description of 
<tp:taxon-name>
Chinoperla gorohovi
</tp:taxon-name>
from northern 
Vietnam
, in regards of head pattern, male terminalia, aedeagal tube, and the long apical spine of the aedeagal sac. However, the Chinese specimens differ in having two membranous dorsomedial lobes on the aedeagal sac (compare 
Fig. 12A–B
with 
Sivec &amp; Stark 2010
: fig. 2). In the 
type
specimens, the aedeagal sac apically has only one dorsal membranous lobe. In addition, the aedeagal sac of the Chinese specimens have an obscure, slightly sclerotized ventroapical patch, without a ventroapical spinose lobe, while in the 
type
specimens, the aedeagal sac lacks the sclerotized ventroapical area, but has a short additional ventroapical spinose lobe. Unfortunately, the 
type
specimens are permanently not available for study due to the re-organization of the Slovenian Museum of Natural History, Ljubljana (PMSL) collection (Ignac Sivec pers. com.).
